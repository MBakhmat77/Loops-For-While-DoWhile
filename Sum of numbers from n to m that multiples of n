Sum of numbers from n to m that are multiples of n
question
You are given two numbers n and m. 
Find the sum of integers from n to m, inclusive, 
that are multiples of n.

Write a function called sumMultN that takes 
two numbers n, m and returns the sum of numbers n
through m that are multiples of n. Use a for loop in your solution.

function sumMultN(n, m){
let sum = 0;
let b = 0;
for ( let i = n; i <= m; i= i + n){

sum = sum  + i;
}
return sum;
